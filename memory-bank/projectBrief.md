# VirtComp - Virtual Computer Simulation

## Purpose

Define the main purpose of this project.

## Target Users

Describe who will use this.


## Project Summary

VirtComp is a comprehensive virtual computer simulation featuring a custom 32-bit CPU architecture, device-based I/O system, and visual debugger. It provides a complete environment for learning computer architecture, assembly programming, and system design.



## Goals

- Provide educational platform for computer architecture and assembly programming
- Implement complete virtual computer with CPU, memory, and I/O devices
- Support hex-based programming with comments and documentation
- Offer visual debugging through ImGui-based interface
- Enable extensible device system for virtual and real hardware
- Support program compilation to standalone executables



## Constraints

- C++17 compatible compiler required
- Uses custom hex format for programs
- Limited to 32-bit addressing
- Memory size constrained to 256 bytes default
- Linux-focused development environment



## Stakeholders

- Students learning computer architecture
- Educators teaching system design
- Developers interested in virtual machine implementation
- Assembly language programmers
- System designers and architects
