The following opcodes are planned to be added:

Stack and Call operations: (COMPLETE)
- CALL: Calls a subroutine by pushing the return address onto the stack and jumping to the subroutine.
- RET: Returns from a subroutine by popping the return address from the stack and jumping back.
- PUSH_ARG: Pushes an argument onto the stack.
- POP_ARG: Pops an argument from the stack.

Input/Output operations: (COMPLETE) (keep in mind that these are virtual I/O operations (serial ports can be used for this))
-/ IN: Inputs data from a port or device.
-/ OUT: Outputs data to a port or device.
-/ INB: Inputs a byte from a port or device.
-/ OUTB: Outputs a byte to a port or device.
-/ INW: Inputs a word from a port or device.
-/ OUTW: Outputs a word to a port or device.
-/ INL: Inputs a long from a port or device.
-/ OUTL: Outputs a long to a port or device.
-/ INSTR: Inputs a string from a port or device.
-/ OUTSTR: Outputs a string to a port or device.

Enhance DB:
- Currently, we save 

Flags and Status operations:
- PUSHF: Pushes the flags register onto the stack.
- POPF: Pops the flags register from the stack.

Memory operations:
- LEA: Loads an effective address, useful for pointer arithmetic.
- SWAP: Swaps the values of two registers.

Conditional jumps for more granularity:
- JC / JNC: Jump if carry or no carry.
- JO / JNO: Jump if overflow or no overflow.
- JG, JL, JGE, JLE: Jump if greater, less, greater or equal, or less or equal (for both signed and unsigned comparisons).

Additionally, virtual storage will be added at a low level, including:
- Virtual storage types such as RAM, ROM, and VHDD.
- A virtual storage controller, bus, interface, driver, and manager.
- A virtual storage API.
- Support for virtual files and directories.

GUI Current Issues:
- Log output auto scrolling is not working properly.
- Programs not executing properly in the debug gui.
