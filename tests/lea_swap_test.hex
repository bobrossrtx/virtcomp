# Test program for LEA (Load Effective Address) and SWAP opcodes
# This program demonstrates the new memory management instructions

# Test LEA - Load Effective Address
01 00 42    # LOAD_IMM R0, 0x42   (load value 66 into R0)
20 01 50    # LEA R1, 0x50        (load address 0x50 into R1)
07 00 50    # STORE R0, 0x50      (store R0 value at address 0x50)

# Test SWAP - Swap register with memory
01 02 AA    # LOAD_IMM R2, 0xAA   (load value 170 into R2)
21 02 50    # SWAP R2, 0x50       (swap R2 with memory[0x50])

# At this point:
# - R2 should contain 0x42 (original value from memory[0x50])
# - memory[0x50] should contain 0xAA (original value from R2)

# Test LEA with different address
20 03 60    # LEA R3, 0x60        (load address 0x60 into R3)

FF          # HALT
